    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Intelligence quotient and the abbreviation (IQ) from psychologist William Stern\n",
    "\n",
    "### Unlike temperature or speed, intelligence is not a concrete measure but an estimate.  Historically achieved by dividing a person's mental age score, obtained by administering an intelligence test, by the person's chronological age. Given the abstract nature of the concept, intelligence and ways of measuring and statistics bear a level of contradiction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### While IQ has been measured for over 100 years now, there are still debates about heritability estimates and the mechanisms of inheritance, on the other hand IQ scores have shown to be associated with such factors as, social economics, nutrition, mortality, social status and strong predictors of job performance and income.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reliability and validity of tests, test bias\n",
    "High statistical reliability based on measurement consistency of the test meaning similar scores upon repetition. The confidence interval is approximately 10 points while standard error of measurement as low as 3 points.\n",
    "To note IQ tests may fail to serve as an accurate measure of broader definitions of human intelligence inclusive of, for example, creativity and social intelligence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Differential item functioning (DIF), sometimes referred to as measurement bias, is a phenomenon when participants from different groups (e.g. gender, race, disability) with the same latent abilities give different answers to specific questions on the same IQ test. [1]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Flynn effect\n",
    "Since the early 20th century, raw scores on IQ tests have increased in most parts of the world. When a new version of an IQ test is normed, the standard scoring is set so performance at the population median results in a score of IQ 100. The phenomenon of rising raw score performance means if test-takers are scored by a constant standard scoring rule, IQ test scores have been rising at an average rate of around three IQ points per decade. This phenomenon was named the Flynn effect in the book The Bell Curve after James R. Flynn, the author who did the most to bring this phenomenon to the attention of psychologists [2]\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data set and Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "My data set consist of four columns 'IQ_Score','Gender','Social Economics','DOB_Year'and an additional index column for helping to assign the appropiate gender to the randomly generated IQ score.\n",
    "There are 1000 elements for each category, male/female 50/50 ratio.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- #### IQ score\n",
    "Generated points with random normal distribution,\n",
    "Female score mean 100/ standard deviation 12 / 500 items\n",
    "Male score matching 100 mean while slightly higher standard deviation 18 (males have more variability, which leads to a higher number of males in both tails of the Gaussian distribution *H. Nyborg; Intelligence 52 (2015) 44â€“62. / Richard Haier Sex differences\n",
    "\n",
    "- #### Date of Birth DOB_Year\n",
    "Randomly generated integers from 1900 to 1999, later to be used for adjusting IQ score with Flynn-effect\n",
    "\n",
    "- #### \"Fynn IQ Score\"\n",
    "Above generated IQ score is adjusted for the so-called Flynn-effect, every decade from 1900 raw IQ scores have risen by an average of 3 points. Based on the randomly generated dob year of from 1950 above 0.3 points added per year and same detracted from 1950 to 1900. Splitting at half term allowed me to keep overall mean at 100 for total set of randomly generated gaussian distributed numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- #### Social Economics score\n",
    "Made up measurement with linear correlation between IQ score and factors of social economics, nutrition, social status. Achieved by normalizing the modified IQ score now Flynn IQ to a range between 1-100. as higher the number as better the individual nutrition social, status, education.\n",
    "\n",
    "- #### Gender\n",
    "Male / Female IQ scores generated separately and class tagged using index number and condition  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Correlation between variables\n",
    "\n",
    "IQ male and female generated with only standard deviation varying form each other, DOB birth assigned randomly to the population. Flynn IQ one to one correlation with IQ score having shifted values based on date of birth year.\n",
    "social economic score in data base has a linear relationship with Flynn IQ\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "My attempt is to analyse whether there are significant differences between genders, if IQ score have increased or decreased in the last century, relation between social economics score and IQ values.\n"
