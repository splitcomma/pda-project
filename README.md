## How to run this Jupyter notebook

## Problem Statement

Creating a data set by simulating a real-world phenomenon of my choice.
Modelling and synthesise using Python.

## Requirements

• Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which you could
collect at least one-hundred data points across at least four different variables.
• Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their
relationships with each other.
• Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible.
• Detail your research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook – the
data set itself can simply be displayed in an output cell within the notebook.
